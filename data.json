On mobile, the flowchart displays slightly different text in order to communicate the same points with a separate design (as a complex flowchart would not work well on a mobile screen). The flowchart was well-received and resulted in community requests for a PDF version to use at meetings (which I obliged).",

As the manner of Bland's death (a trashbag) had been debated, it was important to show if there were any other instances of trashbag suicides, as well as what other sorts of objects were used in Texas county jails to commit hangings.",

After combing through data and calling schools to verifying their name origins, I used Texas Education Agency data to visualize the racial make-up of children attending these schools. In the end, I verified 29 public schools in Texas named after prominent Confederate figures, 23 of which were majority-minority. Each school graphic included the number of students attending it for context.",

For the fall issue, my team gave eight articles this special treatment. For the winter, we did all 30+. This featured article, \"Putting on a Happy Face,\" was in the batch of those I designed for the fall group. It later went on to place third nationally in digital design in MSU's Society of News Design awards, the highest placement for a non-team project.",
