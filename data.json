On mobile, the flowchart displays slightly different text in order to communicate the same points with a separate design (as a complex flowchart would not work well on a mobile screen). The flowchart was well-received and resulted in community requests for a PDF version to use at meetings (which I obliged).",

In the end, I verified 29 public schools in Texas named after prominent Confederate figures, 23 of which were majority-minority.

For the fall issue, my team gave eight articles this special treatment. For the winter, we did all 30+. This featured article, \"Putting on a Happy Face,\" was in the batch of those I designed for the fall group. It later went on to place third nationally in digital design in MSU's Society of News Design awards, the highest placement for a non-team project.",
